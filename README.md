## Description

Building robust APIs is a fundamental aspect of modern software development. In this two-part series, we'll guide you through the process of creating a .NET API with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The second part of the series covers deploying the API to Azure Web App using GitHub Actions.

## Part 1 - Local Development

You can either clone a functional local development version of the .NET API from our [GitHub repository]([YourGitHubRepoLink](https://github.com/Selmouni-Abdelilah/CrudWebApi.git)) or build it yourself by following the instructions outlined in the [first article](https://selmouni.hashnode.dev/create-and-deploy-a-net-api-for-crud-operations-to-azure-using-github-actions-part-1) of this series.

## Part 2 - Azure Deployment

In the [second article](https://selmouni.hashnode.dev/create-and-deploy-a-net-web-api-for-crud-operations-to-azure-using-github-actions-part-2) of our series, we'll take the .NET API created in Part 1 and deploy it to Azure Web App using GitHub Actions.
